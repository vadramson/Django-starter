Description: Overview
        ========
        
        While "the admin is not your app", it is often useful to be able to easily add
        a bit of functionality to the admin for internal staff or other internal users
        that are tech savvy enough to use the admin.
        
        There are several third party project such as
        `AdminPlus <https://github.com/jsocol/django-adminplus>`_, but they require the
        user to redefine the Admin.site object.  This is fine for developers who are
        setting up a Django project, but not ideal for developers who are writing
        third party tools for other developers to use in their projects.
        
        django-admin-views attempts to solve this by simply overriding the admin
        templates to provide two features:
        
        1. Easily define custom admin views and link them on the admin pages
        2. Easily add in external URL links
        
        Installation Steps
        ==================
        
        1. ``pip install django-admin-views``
        
        2. Add ``admin_views`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py`` before admin site, i.e. ``django.contrib.admin``
        
        If you are using a custom Admin Site, you'll need to configure the ``ADMIN_VIEWS_SITE`` setting to point to your admin site instance::
        
            ADMIN_VIEWS_SITE = 'myproject.admin.admin_site'
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        All of this magic happens in your model's admin definition.  You simply subclass your
        admin from ``AdminViews`` instead of the standard ``admin.ModelAdmin``.
        In this example we have a custom view that does nothing but redirect the user to CNN
        and a direct URL link that goes to my company's homepage::
        
            from django.contrib import admin
            from django.shortcuts import redirect
        
            from admin_views.admin import AdminViews
        
            from example_app.models import TestModel
        
            class TestAdmin(AdminViews):
                admin_views = (
                                ('Redirect to CNN', 'redirect_to_cnn'),
                                ('Go to revsys.com', 'http://www.revsys.com'),
                    )
        
                def redirect_to_cnn(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    return redirect('http://www.cnn.com')
        
            admin.site.register(TestModel, TestAdmin)
        
        These will now show up in the admin below the usual Django admin model CRUD interfaces
        for `example_app` with a couple of different icons to distinquish between custom admin
        views and a direct URL link.
        
        With this third-party developers need only instruct their users to install their app
        and ``django-admin-views``.
        
        Hope you find it useful and as always feedback is certainly welcome.
